Inequality pertains to the presence of uneven and potentially unfair allocation of resources and opportunities among individuals in a given society.

While researchers studying inequality frequently seek to examine variations in well-being, utility, or happiness, these distinctions in people's inner psychological contentment usually need to be inferred from observable variations in social and economic resources.

In this piece of work, the authors are aimed to analyze four different data sets concerning various aspects of socioeconomic disparities in France. The comprehensive dataset provided encompasses a wide array of variables, with a focus on understanding and analyzing inequalities across different dimensions. The purpose of this study is to delve into the multifaceted nature of inequalities within the country by exploring the variables included in the dataset.

Through the examination of variables such as company size distribution, geographical data, salary information based on job categories, age, and gender, as well as demographic data including age, gender, lifestyle, and cohabitation modes, the aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and dynamics that contribute to unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and outcomes across different regions and segments of the population.

By combining and analyzing these diverse variables, this study seeks to provide insights into the factors driving disparities in income, employment, gender, age groups, and living conditions. Ultimately, the findings derived from this exploration can aid policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders in developing informed strategies to address and mitigate the various forms of inequalities present in France, fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.

In France, a person qualifies as poor if their standard of living is less than 60% of the median standard of living. In 2016, this equated to a monthly income of â‚¬1,026 for a single person, or roughly 14% of the population.

Inequality is a multifactorial issue. Some parameters have been developed aiming to establish objective and comparable measurements which help to evaluate and ultimately reduce inequality (See miscellanea)

Income & Wealth: The S80/S20 income share ratio (=ratio of the average income of the 20% richest to the 20% poorest).

Housing: Overcrowding rate.

Work: Gender wage gap

Job quality: Long hours in paid work.
